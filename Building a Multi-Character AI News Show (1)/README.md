# AI News Show - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The AI News Show is a multi-character interactive news broadcast featuring real-time generated voice, on-screen 2D animations, and a producer's control panel. The system pulls in real news from the Google News API (filtered for AI/ML/Tech/Futurology) and can generate fictional news when no major items are available.

## Key Features

- **Five Unique Characters**: Each with distinct personality, voice, and visual avatar
  - Macallan (human host) – witty, ironic, narcissistic persona
  - Zyx-9 (AI with quantum powers) – mind-bending, half-sarcastic logic
  - The Blob (confused alien) – comedic relief, naive commentary
  - Glitch (digital conspiracy theorist) – hunts for secrets, insider knowledge
  - Chronos (time-traveling historian) – offers historical connections

- **Real-Time Voice Generation**: Using OpenAI's Realtime API for minimal latency
  - Character-specific voice settings
  - Lip-sync animation synchronized with audio
  - Streaming audio playback

- **Interactive Producer Panel**:
  - Password-protected access
  - Character energy level controls
  - Custom story injection
  - News queue management
  - Emergency stop functionality

- **Live Chat System**:
  - Real-time messaging between viewers
  - Character interactions with chat
  - Username authentication

- **News Management**:
  - Google News API integration
  - Fallback to generated "fake news"
  - Breaking news ticker

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io
- **Animation**: PIXI.js
- **Voice Generation**: OpenAI Realtime API
- **Database**: File-based storage (upgradable to MongoDB)
