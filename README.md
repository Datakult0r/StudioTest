AI News Show - Project Summary
Project Overview
The AI News Show is a multi-character interactive news broadcast featuring real-time generated voice, on-screen 2D animations, and a producer's control panel. The system pulls in real news from the Google News API (filtered for AI/ML/Tech/Futurology) and can generate fictional news when no major items are available.

Key Features
Five Unique Characters: Each with distinct personality, voice, and visual avatar

Macallan (human host) – witty, ironic, narcissistic persona
Zyx-9 (AI with quantum powers) – mind-bending, half-sarcastic logic
The Blob (confused alien) – comedic relief, naive commentary
Glitch (digital conspiracy theorist) – hunts for secrets, insider knowledge
Chronos (time-traveling historian) – offers historical connections
Real-Time Voice Generation: Using OpenAI's Realtime API for minimal latency

Character-specific voice settings
Lip-sync animation synchronized with audio
Streaming audio playback
Interactive Producer Panel:

Password-protected access
Character energy level controls
Custom story injection
News queue management
Emergency stop functionality
Live Chat System:

Real-time messaging between viewers
Character interactions with chat
Username authentication
News Management:

Google News API integration
Fallback to generated "fake news"
Breaking news ticker
Technical Implementation
Frontend: Next.js with Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js with Express
Real-time Communication: Socket.io
Animation: PIXI.js
Voice Generation: OpenAI Realtime API
Database: File-based storage (upgradable to MongoDB)
